And the hits keep on coming.  ┬ノ─┬ノ︵( ⸰ ˘ ⸰ )

* Michael Schwern [sues](https://www.gittip.com/noirin/) Nóirín Plunkett :(
* Jeff Atwood makes [a well-intentioned first effort](http://blog.codinghorror.com/what-can-men-do/) containing a whole bunch of, for want of a better word, rookie mistakes.  :(  Go read [Shanley's original post](https://medium.com/tech-culture-briefs/a1e93d985af0) instead.
* Actually, Annalee at GeekFeminism has written [a roundup of the whole crapfest of this past week](http://geekfeminism.org/2014/04/25/a-week-in-the-life/), just go read that instead.

Dear people and organizations in technology who I like and respect: please behave better wrt diversity and inclusion.

P.S. On the other hand, a tip of the hat to [Luke Kanies](https://twitter.com/puppetmasterd) and [James Turnbull](https://twitter.com/kartar) for reaffirming my faith in the DevOps community.  Keep it up, gents.
