So, a regional Comcast outage (and associated interruption of my home broadband connection) has finally completed my transformation into full-blown DevOps Hipster.

I have packed my sticker-festooned MacBook and my vintage studio headphones into my messenger bag and strolled off to the local coffee shop (bearing in hand a burnt-out CFL bulb, to be recycled at the hardware store en route), there to finish out the workday stroking my goatee while I contemplate the AWS console and try to write some Java. :)
