First off, hooray for the MBTA's [commuter rail WiFi](http://www.mbta.com/riding_the_t/wifi/), which enabled me to both catch my train home and also pay attention to an issue at work which occurred just after I left (especially because I was the proximal cause of the issue :p ).  My phone will work in a pinch, but it's awfully limited compared to my laptop.

Double hooray for my [Sesame Ring](http://www.ringtheory.com/), keeping me from having to repeatedly dig my wallet out of my pocket as I traversed various other public transit methods running errands after work.

>Gloria rode the subway Sunday  
Sic transit gloria mundi

As a side note, please let me know if you know the source of the above quotation; I have a vague recollection of having encountered it in [GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%2C_Escher%2C_Bach), but I don't have my print copy close at hand right now.
