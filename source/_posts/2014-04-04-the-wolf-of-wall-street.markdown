As I was buying a cup of coffee this morning, the barista told me that I was wearing the same shirt as a character from [The Wolf of Wall Street](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_of_Wall_Street_(2013_film)).  It's one of my favorite shirts, and quite distinctive, so I believe her; now I want to see the movie in order to determine how I feel about this.
