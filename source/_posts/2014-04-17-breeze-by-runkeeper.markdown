OH HEY YOU GUYS WE MADE AN APP

RunKeeper just launched [a new app called Breeze](http://breezeapp.com)!  It's a daily activity tracker for the iPhone 5S, and I am tremendously excited about it.  If you're at all interested in [Quantified Self](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantified_Self)-style life tracking, please take a look!
