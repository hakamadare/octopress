I'm mad with power!  I have [CloudFront API access](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/APIReference/) and I'm not afraid to use it!  I sound my [barbaric yawp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Myself) over the roofs of the world!

Reading the documentation for the [Open Source Report Card](http://osrc.dfm.io/) led me to the following gem:

### [Exploring Expressions of Emotion in GitHub Commit Messages](http://geeksta.net/geeklog/exploring-expressions-emotions-github-commit-messages/)

It is exactly what it sounds like; NLP plus stats plus the GitHub datastream.  Some of my favorite bits:

* "What stands out in the anger chart compared to the rest is the prominent gap between the "most angry language" VimL and the other languages."
* "regexes are fun and pleasant to work with, in the same way that oranges are purple"
* "lol, I dunno what I'm doing (JavaScript)"
* "Still, I'm a bit surprised of the result, not because Perl is the winner, but because PHP does not seem to surprise people that often, which does not reflect my experience with this language at all."

Seriously, just go read it.  It's awesome.

P.S. And of course, the section on swearing made me think of [The Terrible Mr. Grimshaw](https://web.archive.org/web/20060529181955/http://blog.airdrop.org/archives/000014.html) (audio, NSFW).  Hooray once again for [archive.org](https://archive.org)!
