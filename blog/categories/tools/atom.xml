    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OK, one more quick thing:</p>

<p>I knew from the get-go that I wanted to host this blog on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>, and that I wanted to build it with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.  One relatively minor conflict between these two tools, though, is that S3 buckets work well for hosting static sites, but Octopress is built on top of Git, and I was sure I didn&rsquo;t want to be uploading my Git metadata to S3.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website">s3_website</a> is the tool I&rsquo;m using to push my generated site to S3.  It has a config option, <code>exclude_from_upload</code>, which enables you to specify one or more regexes to match files to be excluded from S3 uploads.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &ldquo;I know, I&rsquo;ll use regular expressions.&rdquo; Now they have two problems.</p><footer><strong>Jamie Zawinski <a href="http://www.jwz.org/hacks">http://www.jwz.org/hacks</a></strong></footer></blockquote></p>

<p>Yeah, it turns out that putting the string <code>.git</code> in my excludes list (instead of <code>\.git</code>) broke a variety of things on the site, including but not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>my GitHub status in the sidebar</li>
<li>a post with &ldquo;GitHub&rdquo; in the title</li>
<li>Disqus comment counts</li>
</ul>


<p>So yeah, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the way home today I encountered one of our housemates, also homeward bound, and as we came in the front door I was chattering happily about my second day at work.  I have tasks!  Tasks that I can perform!  This is really exciting.</p>

<p>I was, however, interrupted mid-sentence by a crash from the hallway, where Elijah (one of our cats) had knocked a box of tissues from the shelf to the floor.  He was standing by it staring at me, and I got the distinct sense that this was a warning shot across my bows, indicating that I should shut up about trivialities and focus on the much more important topic of his dinner.</p>

<h3>Vim, Pathogen, and dirty submodules</h3>

<p>Earlier today I had been adding Vim plugins to my dotfiles repository, pulling them in as <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">Git submodules</a> for use with <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a>.  I installed a couple of plugins and then generated the Vim help tags for them, which led to a minor unsightliness when the generated tags file showed up as untracked changes in my dotfiles directory.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tpope">Tim Pope</a> suggests working around this problem by setting a <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">global excludes file</a>, but I am vaguely concerned that this will just create a landmine that I will step on at some future time when I want to be capturing some entirely unrelated file called <code>tags</code>.  Instead I discovered that <a href="http://www.nils-haldenwang.de/frameworks-and-tools/git/how-to-ignore-changes-in-git-submodules">this fellow has the exact same problem</a>, and his solution works great for me.  Thanks, Nils!</p>
