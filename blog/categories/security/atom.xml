    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I promise that this is not going to become the All Heartbleed All The Time blog, but in my defence, this is <a href="http://blog.jcuff.net/2011/12/cautionary-tale-about-storage-and.html">kind of a big deal</a>.</p>

<p>A vendor called <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/overview">CloudFlare</a> decided to perform a practical test of the exploitability of Heartbleed by setting up a vulnerable site and <a href="http://blog.cloudflare.com/answering-the-critical-question-can-you-get-private-ssl-keys-using-heartbleed">challenging people to steal the private key</a>.  I think these two quotes encapsulate the story perfectly:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Hereâ€™s the good <a href="news:">news:</a> after extensive testing on our software stack, we have been unable to successfully use Heartbleed on a vulnerable server to retrieve any private key data.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>followed by:</p>

<p><blockquote><p>It turns out we were wrong. While it takes effort, it is possible to extract private SSL keys. The challenge was solved by Software Engineer Fedor Indutny and Ilkka Mattila at NCSC-FL roughly 9 hours after the challenge was first published.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Now consider a tool that <a href="http://blog.vpetkov.net/2014/04/11/ridiculously-fast-heartbleed-subnet-scanner-nmap-heartbleed-howto-and-tutorial/">my buddy Ventz put together</a> for bulk scanning of network segments to detect Heartbleed-vulnerable webservers.  There&rsquo;s no reason to believe that he was the first person to think of building something like this.</p>

<p>The two lessons I see here are the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Remember that there&rsquo;s a difference between &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t do it&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s impossible&rdquo; :)  Smart people tend to forget this, to their and others' detriment.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_through_obscurity">security through obscurity</a>.  If your service is accessible from the public Internet, you should assume that you are being scanned on a regular basis.</p></li>
</ol>

    <id>http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/psa-heartbleed-openssl-vulnerability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over dinner last night one of my friends was talking about an OpenSSL vulnerability that had just been disclosed; this morning I took a closer look and decided that I want to boost the signal a bit</p>

<p>The <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a> OpenSSL vulnerability affects recent releases of <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>.  Affected systems can be made to reveal secret keys; this is arguably one of the worst ways in which an encryption library can fail, and if you are publishing anything that is secured with SSL (<em>e.g.</em> HTTPS, SMTP/IMAP with TLS, LDAPS, to name a few common uses) and using a vulnerable version, then you should treat your keys as compromised, generate a new private key, and generate new certificates.</p>

<p>If you are not your own sysadmin, then you should find out whether your service providers (including your employer) are reacting appropriately to this issue.  Responsible service providers may proactively publish statements about the issue; if you don&rsquo;t find anything on your provider&rsquo;s website, contact technical support.</p>

<p>More information about this vulnerability can be found by consulting <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0160">the CERT advisory</a>; there are also some nice StackExchange questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55076/what-should-a-website-operator-do-about-the-heartbleed-openssl-exploit?">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55076/what-should-a-website-operator-do-about-the-heartbleed-openssl-exploit?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/587329/heartbleed-what-is-it-and-what-are-options-to-mitigate-it">https://serverfault.com/questions/587329/heartbleed-what-is-it-and-what-are-options-to-mitigate-it</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Responding to security vulnerabilities is always a tradeoff between effort and threat, but this one seems worth paying attention to.</p>
