So, a couple of weeks ago [we](http://runkeeper.com) challenged the [MBTA](http://mbta.com) to a [road race](http://outrunthet.runkeeper.com).  My colleague Matt and I [posted on our engineering blog](http://engineering.runkeeper.com/post/93511659022/outrun-the-t-preparing-for-the-unknown) about some of the backend work we did to support this event.

I really love this stuff. :)
