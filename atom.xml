    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If you haven&rsquo;t yet <a href="http://heartbleed.com">patched your OpenSSL and regenerated your certs</a>, stop reading and go fix it; it&rsquo;s OK, I&rsquo;ll still be here when you get back.</p>

<p>All set?  OK.  I found an interesting analysis of the bug over at <a href="http://blog.existentialize.com/diagnosis-of-the-openssl-heartbleed-bug.html">this guy Sean Cassidy&rsquo;s blog</a>.  In brief: I have been happy for many years that other people like to write C, because it means both that I get to benefit from their work (basically my entire livelihood is based on the C ecosystem) and also that I generally don&rsquo;t have to write it myself. :)</p>

<p>In other news, I think I accumulated my first piece of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html">technical debt</a> at the new job today.  I spent a while fighting with <a href="http://blog.jonliv.es/2011/04/26/creating-your-own-signed-apt-repository-and-debian-packages/">signed apt packages</a>; by the time I headed home I had managed to unbreak the repository, but I still have one Java package with an invalid signature, so tomorrow I&rsquo;ll go another few rounds.</p>

    <updated>2014-04-08T16:36:53-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/psa-heartbleed-openssl-vulnerability</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Over dinner last night one of my friends was talking about an OpenSSL vulnerability that had just been disclosed; this morning I took a closer look and decided that I want to boost the signal a bit</p>

<p>The <a href="http://heartbleed.com/">Heartbleed</a> OpenSSL vulnerability affects recent releases of <a href="http://www.openssl.org/">OpenSSL</a>.  Affected systems can be made to reveal secret keys; this is arguably one of the worst ways in which an encryption library can fail, and if you are publishing anything that is secured with SSL (<em>e.g.</em> HTTPS, SMTP/IMAP with TLS, LDAPS, to name a few common uses) and using a vulnerable version, then you should treat your keys as compromised, generate a new private key, and generate new certificates.</p>

<p>If you are not your own sysadmin, then you should find out whether your service providers (including your employer) are reacting appropriately to this issue.  Responsible service providers may proactively publish statements about the issue; if you don&rsquo;t find anything on your provider&rsquo;s website, contact technical support.</p>

<p>More information about this vulnerability can be found by consulting <a href="http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2014-0160">the CERT advisory</a>; there are also some nice StackExchange questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55076/what-should-a-website-operator-do-about-the-heartbleed-openssl-exploit?">http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55076/what-should-a-website-operator-do-about-the-heartbleed-openssl-exploit?</a></li>
<li><a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/587329/heartbleed-what-is-it-and-what-are-options-to-mitigate-it">https://serverfault.com/questions/587329/heartbleed-what-is-it-and-what-are-options-to-mitigate-it</a></li>
</ul>


<p>Responding to security vulnerabilities is always a tradeoff between effort and threat, but this one seems worth paying attention to.</p>

    <link href="http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/pem-files/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-07T20:49:22-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/pem-files</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OK, I am tired of forgetting this information and having to re-research it.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.pem#Certificate_filename_extensions">PEM file</a> is an X.509 digital certificate, specifically a &ldquo;Base64 encoded DER certificate&rdquo; (thank you Wikipedia).  The components are concatenated in the following format:</p>

<ol>
<li>Private key (optional)</li>
<li>Server certificate</li>
<li>Intermediate certificate (optional)</li>
<li>Root certificate (optional)</li>
</ol>


<p>or, in other words, <code>cat server.key server.crt ca-bundle.crt &gt;&gt; server.pem</code>.</p>

<p>That is my final word on the subject.</p>

<p>This evening did not involve attending our intended <a href="http://petermulvey.com/">Peter Mulvey</a> concert, but did involve hanging out at home with various friends and drinking a <a href="http://wiki.webtender.com/wiki/Bourbon_Triple_Sec_Lemon_Juice">Bourble</a>; I hadn&rsquo;t previously encountered this cocktail, but rather mixed it in an attempt to finish off a bottle of triple sec.  It wasn&rsquo;t bad; I found the lemon juice a bit too strong and will use less next time, or maybe lime juice, or maybe a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meyer_lemon">Meyer lemon</a> if I have one handy.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As I was buying a cup of coffee this morning, the barista told me that I was wearing the same shirt as a character from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wolf_of_Wall_Street_(2013_film">The Wolf of Wall Street</a>).  It&rsquo;s one of my favorite shirts, and quite distinctive, so I believe her; now I want to see the movie in order to determine how I feel about this.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Colossal_Failure_of_Common_Sense">A Colossal Failure of Common Sense</a>, to put this in some more context :)</p>

    <link href="http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/octopress/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-03T21:49:10-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/octopress</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>OK, one more quick thing:</p>

<p>I knew from the get-go that I wanted to host this blog on <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/">S3</a>, and that I wanted to build it with <a href="http://octopress.org/">Octopress</a>.  One relatively minor conflict between these two tools, though, is that S3 buckets work well for hosting static sites, but Octopress is built on top of Git, and I was sure I didn&rsquo;t want to be uploading my Git metadata to S3.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/laurilehmijoki/s3_website">s3_website</a> is the tool I&rsquo;m using to push my generated site to S3.  It has a config option, <code>exclude_from_upload</code>, which enables you to specify one or more regexes to match files to be excluded from S3 uploads.</p>

<blockquote><p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &#8220;I know, I&#8217;ll use regular expressions.&#8221; Now they have two problems.</p><footer><strong>Jamie Zawinski</strong> <cite><a href='http://www.jwz.org/hacks'>www.jwz.org/hacks/&hellip;</a></cite></footer></blockquote>


<p>Yeah, it turns out that putting the string <code>.git</code> in my excludes list (instead of <code>\.git</code>) broke a variety of things on the site, including but not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>my GitHub status in the sidebar</li>
<li>a post with &ldquo;GitHub&rdquo; in the title</li>
<li>Disqus comment counts</li>
</ul>


<p>So yeah, don&rsquo;t do that.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First off, hooray for the MBTA&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mbta.com/riding_the_t/wifi/">commuter rail WiFi</a>, which enabled me to both catch my train home and also pay attention to an issue at work which occurred just after I left (especially because I was the proximal cause of the issue :p ).  My phone will work in a pinch, but it&rsquo;s awfully limited compared to my laptop.</p>

<p>Double hooray for my <a href="http://www.ringtheory.com/">Sesame Ring</a>, keeping me from having to repeatedly dig my wallet out of my pocket as I traversed various other public transit methods running errands after work.</p>

<p>As a side note, please let me know if you know the source of the above quotation; I have a vague recollection of having encountered it in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%2C_Escher%2C_Bach">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>, but I don&rsquo;t have my print copy close at hand right now.</p>

    <id>http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/you-had-one-job</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the way home today I encountered one of our housemates, also homeward bound, and as we came in the front door I was chattering happily about my second day at work.  I have tasks!  Tasks that I can perform!  This is really exciting.</p>

<p>I was, however, interrupted mid-sentence by a crash from the hallway, where Elijah (one of our cats) had knocked a box of tissues from the shelf to the floor.  He was standing by it staring at me, and I got the distinct sense that this was a warning shot across my bows, indicating that I should shut up about trivialities and focus on the much more important topic of his dinner.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://someguyontheinter.net/images/one_job.jpg" width="746" height="550" title="&#34;you had one job&#34;" alt="&#34;you had one job&#34;"></p>

<h3>Vim, Pathogen, and dirty submodules</h3>

<p>Earlier today I had been adding Vim plugins to my dotfiles repository, pulling them in as <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule">Git submodules</a> for use with <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen">Pathogen</a>.  I installed a couple of plugins and then generated the Vim help tags for them, which led to a minor unsightliness when the generated tags file showed up as untracked changes in my dotfiles directory.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tpope">Tim Pope</a> suggests working around this problem by setting a <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore">global excludes file</a>, but I am vaguely concerned that this will just create a landmine that I will step on at some future time when I want to be capturing some entirely unrelated file called <code>tags</code>.  Instead I discovered that <a href="http://www.nils-haldenwang.de/frameworks-and-tools/git/how-to-ignore-changes-in-git-submodules">this fellow has the exact same problem</a>, and his solution works great for me.  Thanks, Nils!</p>

    <link href="http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/first-day-at-runkeeper/"/>
    <updated>2014-04-01T22:57:14-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://someguyontheinter.net/blog/first-day-at-runkeeper</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m winding down at the end of my first day at <a href="http://runkeeper.com">RunKeeper</a>, and I&rsquo;m still walking on air :)  Today started with me apparently being a bit jittery while shaving this morning:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="http://someguyontheinter.net/images/shaving_cuts.jpg" width="240" height="320" title="&#34;ouch&#34;" alt="&#34;ouch&#34;"></p>

<p>and ended with me running (while wearing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sanita-457806M-20-Professional-Cabrio-Clog/dp/B001CWYZME">clogs</a>, ow) to North Station to catch the commuter rail, and today was STILL awesome.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s really good to work with my old boss Matt again, and I&rsquo;m really liking the generally happy atmosphere, and the tiny dog wandering around the office, and I&rsquo;ve already come up with some tasks I want to try to get my arms around in the near future.  Plus I didn&rsquo;t break anything on the first day!</p>

<p>I spent a chunk of the past week building my new laptop by means of <a href="https://boxen.github.com">Boxen</a>, and I really like this approach to workstation management.  A lot of the work I&rsquo;ve been doing during the past few years focuses on server and application automation, and as a result my servers tend to be (relatively) neat and well-ordered while my laptop is a wretched hive of scum and villainy; if I recall correctly, the laptop that I handed in last week contained the fifth generation of a lovingly hand-crafted workstation configuration, which started out as a Mac OS X 10.2 installation on a PowerPC Mac laptop and underwent multiple ordeals of Migration Assistant/Carbon Copy Cloner/etc. to attain its final Mac OS X 10.7 on Intel status, accumulating tons of cruft as it went.</p>

<p>So now my workstation config lives in a GitHub repository, and deploying it onto a new machine is remarkably straightforward.  I have about 70% of what I need captured in code; now I just need to be reasonably diligent about keeping up with changes I make post-installation, and next time around I will be much happier.</p>

<p>Current ruling on Boxen:</p>

<p>Pro:</p>

<ul>
<li>configuration captured in code</li>
<li>safe to re-apply config repeatedly</li>
<li>upstream maintainers quite responsive to pull requests</li>
</ul>


<p>Con:</p>

<ul>
<li>no simple way to handle apps that require post-installation configuration (maybe capture <code>.plist</code> files in the repo as templates? yuck)</li>
<li><em>really</em> does not play nicely with multiple local users on the same host (I may have to end up abandoning my habit of maintaining one user account for work and one for personal use, and leveraging <a href="http://www.controlplaneapp.com">ControlPlane</a> to compensate)</li>
</ul>

<p>P.S. Oh right, I had also stumbled belatedly onto this Garamond silliness via <a href="http://www.thomasphinney.com/2014/03/saving-400m-font/">this excellent refutation</a>.  My only contribution to the debate, such as it is, is to suggest that Garamond is weaksauce and that real toner-savers use <a href="http://ecofont.com/">Ecofont</a>.</p>

I have <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/APIReference/">CloudFront API access</a> and I&rsquo;m not afraid to use it!  I sound my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Song_of_Myself">barbaric yawp</a> over the roofs of the world!</p>

<p>Reading the documentation for the <a href="http://osrc.dfm.io/">Open Source Report Card</a> led me to the following gem:</p>

<h3><a href="http://geeksta.net/geeklog/exploring-expressions-emotions-github-commit-messages/">Exploring Expressions of Emotion in GitHub Commit Messages</a></h3>

<p>It is exactly what it sounds like; NLP plus stats plus the GitHub datastream.  Some of my favorite bits:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;What stands out in the anger chart compared to the rest is the prominent gap between the &#8220;most angry language&rdquo; VimL and the other languages.&#8221;</li>
<li>&ldquo;regexes are fun and pleasant to work with, in the same way that oranges are purple&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;lol, I dunno what I&rsquo;m doing (JavaScript)&rdquo;</li>
<li>&ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;m a bit surprised of the result, not because Perl is the winner, but because PHP does not seem to surprise people that often, which does not reflect my experience with this language at all.&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>Seriously, just go read it.  It&rsquo;s awesome.</p>

<p>-steve</p>

<p>P.S. And of course, the section on swearing made me think of <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060529181955/http://blog.airdrop.org/archives/000014.html">The Terrible Mr. Grimshaw</a> (audio, NSFW).  Hooray once again for <a href="https://archive.org">archive.org</a>!</p>
